# The Continnum Approximation
The physics of continuum mechanics, requires that a mass of particles can be 
modelled as continuous matter where the particles are infinitesimal. 

*"Whether a given number of molecules is large enough to warrant the use of 
a smooth continuum description of matter depends on the desired precision. 
Since matter is never continuous at sufficiently high precision, continuum 
phyiscs is always an approximation. But as long as the fluctuations in 
physical quantities caused by the discreteness of matter are smaller than 
the desired precision, matter may be taken to be continuous. To observe the 
continuity, one must so to speak avoid looking too sharply at material bodies. 
Fontenelle stated in a similar context that; 
"Science originates from curiosity and bad eyesight"."*
