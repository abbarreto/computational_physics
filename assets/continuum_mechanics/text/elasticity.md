## __Work__
Work can be defined for deformations in a continuum. 
Its defined by the ":" operator.
$$
W=\sigma:u
$$
where $\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $u$ is the Cauchy strain tensor.
The ":" operator takes sum of the elementvise product, i.e.
$$
W=\sum_{ij} \sigma_{ij} u_{ij}
$$
The units will be in Pascal, which essentially is the same as Joules.

## __Hookes Law__
The general case, Hookes Law can be expressed as
$$
\sigma = E u
$$
Where E is a rank 4 tensor, relating all the components of the Cauchy strain tensor and the Cauchy stress tensor. 

The problem then becomes given in terms of the force density $f^*$.
$$
f^* = f + \nabla \cdot \sigma
$$
Where $f$ is the body forces like gravity. This is analytically unsolvable for most systems, we can however use finite difference approximations to solve it numerically.
