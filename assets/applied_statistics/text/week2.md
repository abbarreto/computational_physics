Week 2 (PDFs, Likelihood, Systematic Errors):
Nov 28: Probability Density Functions (PDF) especially Binomial, Poisson and Gaussian.
Nov 29: Principle of maximum likelihood and fitting (which is an art!).
Dec 2: 8:15 - Group A: Project (for Wednesday the 14th of December) doing experiments in First Lab.
            9:15 - Group B: Systematic Uncertainties and analysis of "Table Measurement data" Discussion of real data analysis (usual rooms).


# Header 1
### Probability density functions (PDFs)
*a function of a continuous random variable, whose integral across an interval gives the probability that the value of the variable lies within the same interval.*

### Binomial distribution
$$
     math
$$
### Poisson distribution
$$
     math
$$
### Gaussian distribution
$$
     math
$$


# Header 2
### Principle of maximum likelihood and fitting
$$
     likelihood = math
$$

we want to maximize this term ^^
