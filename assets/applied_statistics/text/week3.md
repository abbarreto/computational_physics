### Systematic Uncertainties and analysis of "Table Measurement data"


### Producing random numbers and their use in simulations.

We may produce random number using ``np.random.rand()`` (these are uniform). These can be used in simulations, as:
* we may add random error (noise) to our data
* We may let outcomes be decided probablitically (if a $>$ random value: do action.)
