# Complex Physics
In this course, we covered:
* **Statistical Mechanics**, in which we brushed up on copcepts like the partition function, free energy, entropy, their relations and their derivatives. We used this knowledge to simulate the Ising model.
* **Phase transitions & Critical phenomena**, in which we found the mean-field solution to Ising model, solved 1-d Ising model and applied the transfer matrix method.
* **Percolation and fractals**, in which we implemented percolation on different lattice structures to asses the distribution of cluster/domain sizes. Additionally, we looked at fractal dimensions.
* **Self organized criticality**: First return of Random walk, critical branching, the sandpile model, the evolution model.
* **Networks**: Amplification factor, scale free networks, analyzing patterns of networks, algorithms to make or evolve scale free networks.
* **Agent based models & Event based simulation**: simulation with discrrete but random changes, Gillespie algorithm, Example of agent based simulation and its advantages.
* **Econophysics** Hurst exponent, Fear Factor model, Bet hedging with smal and big noise terms.
