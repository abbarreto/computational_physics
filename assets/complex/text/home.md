##### Statistical Mechanics 
Consider systems as a multitude of microstates. Let the partition function give insight into free energy and entropy. #Ising model.

##### Phase transitions & Critical phenomena
Many-body systems can undergo a phase transition at some criticality. Varying a paramter across the criticality causes an abrupt change in the favourability of microstates. 
At the criticality, scale invariant patterns imerge.

##### Percolation and fractals
*How do the pockets of water in a pourous, submerged material look?* Also; fractals.
