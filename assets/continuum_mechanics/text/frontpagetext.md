# Continuum Mechanics
In the macroscopic world, most materials that surround us e.g. solids and 
liquids can safely be assumed to exist as continua, that is, the materials 
completely fill the space they occupy and the underlying atomic structures 
can be neglected. This course offers a modern introduction to the physics of
continuous matter with an emphasis on examples from natural occurring 
systems (e.g. in the physics of complex systems and the Earth sciences). 
Focus is equally on the underlying formalism of continuum mechanics and 
phenomenology. In the course you will become familiar with the mechanical 
behavior of materials ranging from viscous fluids to elastic solids. 

A description of the deformation of solids is given, including the concepts
of mechanical equilibrium, the stress and strain tensors, linear elasticity.
A derivation is given of the Navier-Cauchy equation as well as examples 
from elastostatics and elastodynamics including elastic waves. A 
description of fluids in motion is given including the Euler equations, 
potential flow, Stokes' flow and the Navier-Stokes equation. Examples of 
numerical modeling of continous matter will be given.
