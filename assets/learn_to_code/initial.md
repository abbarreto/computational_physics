# Hello world!
### level 0 - Hello world!
> Go ahead and **print** the *string*; "Hello world!"

# Variables
### level 1 - Variables

Varaibles let us remember values. Variable assignment is done with the **=** sign.
> Assign numbers to two variables and print their sum.

# Operators
### level 2 - Operators
Python can also math, try your standard operators :
$$
\begin{align*}
    + && - && * && / && ** && // && \%
\end{align*}
$$
> Define two numbers to variables, and use each operator on them.


# For loops!
### level 3 - For loops!

Python can do things many times with **loops**!
> Assign you name to a variable & loop over the letters, printing each.


# Functions
### level 4 - Functions

Functions are lists of instructions written as:
```python
def funcName(x):
    print(x)
```
and called like; `funcName(x)`

> Write a function which prints the difference between the squareroot and the square of a single positive number.


# Bubble-sort
### level 5 - Bubble-sort
bubble sort is a an algorithm for sorting an array, which only makes nearest-neighbour comparisons.

$x$ is an array of random numbers.
> sort $x$ using for-loops and comparisons
