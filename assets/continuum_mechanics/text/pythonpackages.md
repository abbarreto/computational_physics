## __Introduction__
Beyond the usual Matplotlib, NumPy and SciPy packages, here are a few recommendations that may help in problem solving.

## __Shapely__
Shapely provides a way to conduct easy geometric calculations and representation.

Highlighted functions: polygon, clip_by_rect,

## __SymPy__
SymPy allows maple/wolframalpha-like calculus analysis inside Python, it is very convenient for automating tensor calculations. Example functions for various tensors are given below.

Highlighted functions: lambdify, symbols

## __Plotly__
Greatly extends the functionality of interactive 3D graphics compared to matplotlib.

Highlighted functions: graph_objects

## __Rasterio__

Geographic information systems use GeoTIFF and other formats to organize and store gridded raster datasets such as satellite imagery and terrain models. Rasterio reads and writes these formats and provides a Python API based on Numpy N-dimensional arrays and GeoJSON.
