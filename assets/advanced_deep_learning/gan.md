# Generative Adversarial Networks

KEY: intro
Generative adversarial networks are a class of neural networks that are used for generative modeling. They are composed of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained to generate data that is similar to the training data, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish between the generated data and the training data. The generator and discriminator are trained in an adversarial manner, hence the name.

To showcase this we will train a GAN to generate images from CIFAR10 (which contains: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks).
